# google-sheet-crypto-scripts
Collection of NFT and Crypto scripts for Google Sheets. This includes getting current prices, floor prices of NFTs, and more in the future.

Here is a link to the Google Sheet which is open to all. This was born from Rad acquiring NFTs from partner projects like DeadHeads, Claylings, Knights of Degen, Fluf World (with Burrows and Party Bears), Jenkins the Valet, and more.

You can:
1) Copy this and modify the script directly in the sheet, or 
2) Start a new sheet and add this script

In either case, the script menu can be accessed from 'Extensions'->'Apps Script'.

Please make modifications and make this better. It was a quick and dirty hack to get floor prices for NFTs from Opensea. It can be updated to include all kinds of fun stuff, and likely improved even in its basic function.
